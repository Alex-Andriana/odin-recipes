        flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped 
        with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients,
        which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in
        a wood-fired oven.A small pizza is sometimes called a
        pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.

        The word "pizza" first appeared in a Latin text from the town
        of Gaeta, then still part of the Byzantine Empire, in 997 AD;
        the text states that a tenant of certain property is to give
        the bishop of Gaeta duodecim pizze every Christmas Day, 
        and another twelve every Easter Sunday.</p>
